How to store current piles? (alist?)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Cards are sorted from newest to oldest of clued,
then newest to oldest of unclued.

Cards can be: playable, useless, indispensable.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Save clue = number, including oldest card, where it's *possible* it's
indispensable and unplayable.
